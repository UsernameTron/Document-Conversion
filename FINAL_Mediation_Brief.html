        <h1>MEDIATION BRIEF</h1>
        <h3>In re: Nelson/Abel v. Christopher Connor and Sherry Connor</h3>
        <p>Property Address: 1109 Eagle Claw Dr, Haslet, TX</p>
        <p>Mediation Date: [Date]</p>
    </div>

    <div class="executive-summary">
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>Based on the evidence and timeline from March through May 2024, Defendants Christopher Connor and Sherry Connor have a strong defense against the landlord's claims. Multiple inconsistencies in documentation, pre-existing property conditions, and proper move-out procedures support our position that the plaintiff's claims are unsubstantiated.</p>
        <p>Critically, the Landlord's own agent has provided written acknowledgment that the lease documentation was confusing (necessitating a clarifying phone call) and has admitted that she had advised the landlord to replace the carpet, confirming the pre‑existing condition. These admissions, combined with the multiple conflicting lease drafts, documented move‑out compliance, and inconsistent recordkeeping, legally support the defense that no valid lease was in effect on May 1, 2024.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="heading-box">
        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <p>This mediation brief is submitted on behalf of Defendants Christopher Connor and Sherry Connor (collectively "Tenants"). The Tenants occupied the subject property from January 2020 until May 2024, when they properly vacated the premises in accordance with all legal requirements. This brief addresses the claims made by Plaintiff Stephanie Nelson/Abel ("Landlord") and demonstrates, through documentary evidence, that the Landlord's claims are legally and factually unsupported.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</h2>
    <p>From 2020 to 2024, the parties maintained a landlord-tenant relationship that was marred by the Landlord's inconsistent documentation, confusing lease arrangements, and attempts to impose terms after the fact. The following timeline establishes key events:</p>

    <div class="timeline">
        <h3>2020: Initial Lease and Move-In</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>In January 2020, Christopher Connor and Sherry Connor signed a lease for 1109 Eagle Claw Dr in Haslet, TX with landlord Stephanie Nelson.</li>
            <li>The tenants had emotional support animals (ESAs) and provided proper documentation, which exempted them from pet fees.</li>
            <li>A special ESA lease amendment was signed on January 12-14, 2020.</li>
            <li>Witness statements document that the carpets had pre-existing stains and damage upon move-in.</li>
            <li>Property listing photos from 2019 (used for advertising) show the carpets in better condition than what tenants found upon move-in.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Landlord Name Inconsistency (Throughout Tenancy)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The landlord alternated between using the names "Stephanie Nelson" and "Stephanie Abel" on documents.</li>
            <li>A chart shows this pattern of name switching between April 2020 and June 2021.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>2022: Handwritten Lease Period</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>For the 2022-2023 lease period, the landlord provided a handwritten lease instead of a typed/digital version.</li>
            <li>This handwritten lease included a double deposit requirement.</li>
            <li>No electronic copy was provided to tenants.</li>
            <li>Evidence suggests possible landlord impairment issues during this period.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>2023: Multiple Lease Confusion</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Multiple confusing lease requests occurred via DocuSign in March-April 2023:
                <ul>
                    <li>March 29, 2023: First DocuSign request</li>
                    <li>March 31, 2023: Second DocuSign request</li>
                    <li>April 1, 2023: Third lease version sent</li>
                    <li>April 29, 2023: New lease sent after signing</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Inconsistencies were found in payment dates (showing first payment due in 2022 for a 2023 lease)</li>
            <li>August 17, 2023: Landlord sent notice that the lease was void after it had been signed</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>2024: Escalation and Legal Issues</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>In March-April 2024, four different lease versions were sent within days:
                <ul>
                    <li>March 27, 2024: First DocuSign request</li>
                    <li>March 31, 2024: Second DocuSign request (just minutes after another communication)</li>
                    <li>March 31, 2024: Another lease dated November 2, 2015 was sent</li>
                    <li>April 1-2, 2024: Additional lease versions sent</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Tenant signatures were apparently dated before final lease was sent</li>
            <li>A lease amendment dated February 1, 2018 was sent in April 2024</li>
            <li>May 1, 2024: Tenants properly vacated premises with movers completing removal</li>
            <li>May 2, 2024: Keys returned to Landlord's mailbox</li>
            <li>May 3, 2024: Forwarding address provided to Landlord</li>
            <li>May 2024: Property was relisted while still under lease</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="main-argument">
        <h2>SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT</h2>
        <p>The Tenants' position is that: (1) no valid, mutually executed lease existed at the time of the alleged breach; (2) the Tenants properly vacated the premises in accordance with all legal requirements; (3) the alleged property damages pre-existed the Tenants' occupancy; (4) the Landlord failed to properly account for the security deposit; and (5) the Landlord's inconsistent conduct and documentation undermine the credibility of her claims.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="key-admission">
        <h3>KEY ADMISSIONS BY LANDLORD'S AGENT</h3>
        <p>Of paramount importance to this case are two critical admissions by the Landlord's own agent:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Written acknowledgment that lease documentation was confusing</strong> - The agent explicitly stated in writing that the lease paperwork was confusing enough to necessitate a clarifying phone call. This admission directly supports the Tenants' position that no clear, enforceable lease agreement was established.</li>
            <li><strong>Admission of pre-existing carpet condition</strong> - The agent admitted in communications that she had previously advised the landlord to replace the carpet, confirming the Tenants' assertion that the carpet damage predated their tenancy.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These admissions by the Landlord's representative, combined with the timeline of events and documentation presented in this brief, legally establish that no valid lease was in effect on May 1, 2024. Consequently, the Landlord's claim of breach is fundamentally undermined by her own representative's statements and her inconsistent actions throughout the tenancy.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>ARGUMENT</h2>

    <div class="evidence-section">
        <h3>I. No Valid, Mutually Executed Lease Existed</h3>
        <p>The evidence conclusively demonstrates that no final, binding lease was agreed upon between the parties. Multiple conflicting lease drafts were circulated, including one voided on April 1, 2024 due to impossible dates. Without a valid lease, the Tenants could not have breached lease terms and continued under a legally recognized month-to-month arrangement.</p>
        
        <p>The evidence shows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In March-April 2024, four different lease versions were sent within days</li>
            <li>The lease signed by Stephanie Nelson on March 27, 2024, was revised multiple times before being sent to Mr. Connor on April 2, 2024, creating a chronological impossibility and undermining mutual assent</li>
            <li>The existence of five conflicting lease versions highlights procedural irregularities and lack of clarity in lease execution</li>
            <li>A lease document dated November 2, 2015 was inexplicably sent on March 31, 2024</li>
            <li>One lease contained impossible payment dates (showing first payment due in 2022 for a 2023 lease)</li>
            <li>The Landlord herself voided a previously signed lease on August 17, 2023</li>
            <li>The Landlord's agent acknowledged in writing that the lease documentation was confusing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Texas law requires mutual assent to identical terms for a lease to be enforceable. The landlord's procedural errors in revising leases after signatures voided any enforceable agreement, resulting in a month-to-month tenancy.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="evidence-section">
        <h3>II. The Tenants Properly Vacated the Property</h3>
        <p>Documentation clearly establishes that the Tenants properly vacated the property and fulfilled all legal obligations for termination:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>April 8, 2024</strong>: Christopher Connor authorized lockbox placement and showings, effectively providing notice of intent to vacate under a month-to-month arrangement</li>
            <li>May 1, 2024: Professional movers completed removal of all Tenants' possessions (verified by moving company receipt)</li>
            <li>May 2, 2024: Keys were properly returned to the Landlord's mailbox (documented by photograph)</li>
            <li>May 3, 2024: Forwarding address was provided to Landlord via certified mail</li>
            <li><strong>June 1, 2024</strong>: Property was re-listed by the landlord</li>
            <li><strong>June 9, 2024</strong>: Property was rented to new tenants</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Texas law requires only that a tenant provide a forwarding address to the landlord, which was done. The Tenants complied with all statutory requirements to properly vacate.</p>
        <p>Further, landlords are required to mitigate damages when tenants vacate. The landlord's quick re-listing and rental of the property by June 9 demonstrates minimal financial loss attributable to the tenants.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="evidence-section">
        <h3>III. Alleged Property Damages Pre-Existed Tenancy</h3>
        <p>The Landlord's claims regarding property damage, particularly to the carpets, are contradicted by substantial evidence showing these conditions existed prior to the Tenants' occupancy:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Photographs from December 2019 (prior to move-in) document pre-existing carpet stains and damage</li>
            <li>Three separate witness statements confirm that carpet damage was present at move-in:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Susan Beckman's Statement (December 2019)</strong>: The leasing agent informed Stephanie Nelson that carpets needed replacement before move-in, and cleaning efforts were insufficient with contractors repeatedly attempting to address flooring issues</li>
                    <li><strong>Sherry Beckman-Connor's Statement (December 2019)</strong>: Observations during the tour confirmed poor carpet condition and insufficient cleaning of the stove</li>
                    <li><strong>Christian Kniesel's Statement (December 2019)</strong>: Confirms leasing agent Chavez advised Nelson about pre-existing carpet issues</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Property listing photos from 2019 used for advertising show better conditions than what Tenants encountered upon move-in, indicating deceptive marketing practices</li>
            <li><strong>The Landlord's own agent admitted in writing that she had previously advised the Landlord to replace the carpet</strong>, confirming the pre-existing condition</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Additionally, the Tenants maintained the property appropriately, as evidenced by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Regular HVAC filter changes (documented by receipts)</li>
            <li>Video evidence contradicting Landlord's claims about garbage disposal damage</li>
            <li>Documentation of appropriate maintenance throughout the tenancy</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Texas law prohibits landlords from deducting for pre-existing damages unless documented in a move-in condition report signed by both parties. The tenant statements corroborate landlord knowledge of pre-existing issues through the leasing agent's acknowledgment.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="evidence-section">
        <h3>IV. Security Deposit Discrepancies</h3>
        <p>The Landlord's demand letter contains critical accounting errors regarding the security deposit:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Original deposit of $1,750 was adjusted to $1,450 after the ESA amendment</li>
            <li>The extra $300 was never refunded to Tenants (constituting an improper retention) as noted in Susan Beckman's statement</li>
            <li>Landlord's demand letter completely fails to deduct the $1,450 deposit amount, effectively attempting to recover funds twice</li>
            <li>The handwritten lease from 2022 improperly attempted to impose a double deposit requirement</li>
            <li>The total unaccounted funds equal $1,750 ($1,450 current deposit plus $300 never returned from the original adjustment)</li>
            <li>Cleaning charges of $975 appear inflated without supporting documentation or invoices</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Under Texas law, the Landlord was required to provide an itemized list of deductions from the security deposit within 30 days of the Tenants providing a forwarding address. The Landlord's demand letter does not comply with these requirements and fails to account for funds already in the Landlord's possession.</p>
        <p>Texas law requires landlords to provide an itemized list of deductions within 30 days or forfeit their right to retain any portion of the deposit. The inflated and undocumented deductions further demonstrate bad faith retention of funds.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="evidence-section">
        <h3>V. Inconsistent Landlord Conduct Undermines Credibility</h3>
        <p>The Landlord's conduct throughout the tenancy raises serious concerns about the credibility of her claims:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Inconsistent use of names, alternating between "Stephanie Nelson" and "Stephanie Abel" on official documents</li>
            <li>A documented pattern of name-switching between April 2020 and June 2021</li>
            <li>The existence of five conflicting lease versions demonstrates poor document management by the landlord</li>
            <li>Circulation of erroneous lease documents, including some with impossible dates</li>
            <li>Evidence of prior litigation with other tenants following similar patterns</li>
            <li>Relisting the property while still allegedly under lease</li>
            <li>Missing Brokerage Disclosure - Miss Connor never received or signed a required brokerage disclosure, violating Texas Real Estate Commission rules</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These inconsistencies suggest a pattern of potentially deceptive practices that cast doubt on the entire basis of the Landlord's claims. Texas real estate regulations mandate proper disclosure practices by leasing agents, and the poor document management casts doubt on all claims made by the landlord.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>LEGAL STANDARDS</h2>
    <p>Under Texas law, a landlord seeking damages must establish:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>A valid, enforceable lease agreement</li>
        <li>Actual damages caused by the tenant (not pre-existing)</li>
        <li>Proper accounting for security deposits and compliance with legal requirements</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The Landlord fails to meet these basic requirements. Furthermore, Texas law imposes penalties on landlords who wrongfully withhold security deposits or fail to provide a proper accounting.</p>

    <h2>SPECIFIC RESPONSES TO DEMAND LETTER CLAIMS</h2>
    <p>The Landlord's demand letter dated [date] seeks approximately $11,800 in damages (after properly accounting for the security deposit). We address each claim specifically, noting that records show reletting occurred within 30 days, which limits any claim for lost rent:</p>

    <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> Documentation shows the property was re-let within 30 days of the Tenants' departure. Under Texas law, a landlord has a duty to mitigate damages by making reasonable efforts to re-let the property. The quick re-letting significantly undercuts any claim for lost rent, particularly when there was no valid lease in effect.</p>

    <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
        <p>The evidence presented in this brief demonstrates that the Landlord's claims against the Tenants are legally and factually unsupported. The agent's written acknowledgment of confusing lease documentation and admission regarding the carpet's pre-existing condition are particularly damaging to the Landlord's case. Combined with the multiple conflicting lease drafts, documented move-out compliance, and inconsistent recordkeeping, these factors conclusively establish that the Landlord's claim of breach is undermined by her own inconsistent actions and the absence of a binding contract on May 1, 2024.</p>
