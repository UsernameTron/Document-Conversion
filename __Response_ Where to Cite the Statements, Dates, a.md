### **Response: Where to Cite the Statements, Dates, and Times in the Mediation Brief**

Below is an analysis of where the provided statements, dates, and times should be cited within the **FINAL Mediation Brief** and recommendations for enhancements to strengthen the tenants’ position.

---

### **1. No Valid, Mutually Executed Lease Existed**

#### Relevant Statements:

- **March 27–April 2, 2024 Lease Timeline**:
    - The lease signed by Stephanie Nelson on March 27, 2024, was revised multiple times before being sent to Mr. Connor on April 2, 2024. This creates a chronological impossibility and undermines mutual assent.
- **Five Lease Versions**:
    - The existence of five conflicting lease versions highlights procedural irregularities and lack of clarity in lease execution.


#### Citation Location:

- Under **Point (1)** in the "Summary of Argument," cite these facts to support the claim that no valid lease existed. Specifically:
    - Mention the **timeline of revisions** and conflicting signatures as evidence of failed contract formation.
    - Reference Texas law requiring mutual assent to identical terms for a lease to be enforceable.


#### Enhancement Recommendation:

- Add a specific reference to **Texas Property Code §91.001**, which governs month-to-month tenancies when no valid written lease exists.
- Include language emphasizing that the landlord’s procedural errors (e.g., revising leases after signatures) voided any enforceable agreement.

---

### **2. Proper Vacation of Premises**

#### Relevant Statements:

- **April 8, 2024 Communication**:
    - Christopher Connor authorized lockbox placement and showings, effectively providing notice of intent to vacate under a month-to-month arrangement.
- **May 1, 2024 Move-Out Date**:
    - The tenants vacated the property by May 1, satisfying statutory notice requirements under Texas law.


#### Citation Location:

- Under **Point (2)** in the "Summary of Argument," use these dates to demonstrate compliance with legal requirements for notice and move-out.
- Highlight that the landlord accepted possession by re-listing and selling the property shortly after May 1.


#### Enhancement Recommendation:

- Reference **Texas Property Code §91.006**, which requires landlords to mitigate damages when tenants vacate.
- Emphasize that the landlord’s quick re-listing and sale of the property demonstrate minimal financial loss attributable to the tenants.

---

### **3. Alleged Property Damages Pre-Existed Tenants' Occupancy**

#### Relevant Statements:

- **Susan Beckman’s Statement (December 2019)**:
    - The leasing agent informed Stephanie Nelson that carpets needed replacement before move-in.
    - Cleaning efforts were insufficient, and contractors repeatedly attempted to address flooring issues.
- **Sherry Beckman-Connor’s Statement (December 2019)**:
    - Observations during the tour confirmed poor carpet condition and insufficient cleaning of the stove.
- **Christian Kniesel’s Statement (December 2019)**:
    - Confirms leasing agent Chavez advised Nelson about pre-existing carpet issues.


#### Citation Location:

- Under **Point (3)** in the "Summary of Argument," cite these statements as evidence that damages (e.g., carpets, stove) existed before tenancy began.
- Use these facts to counter claims for carpet replacement (\$1,832) and stove replacement (\$560).


#### Enhancement Recommendation:

- Include a reference to **Texas Property Code §92.104(c)**, which prohibits landlords from deducting for pre-existing damages unless documented in a move-in condition report signed by both parties.
- Add language emphasizing that tenant statements corroborate landlord knowledge of pre-existing issues (e.g., leasing agent’s acknowledgment).

---

### **4. Failure to Properly Account for Security Deposit**

#### Relevant Statements:

- **Failure to Refund \$300 Deposit Adjustment**:
    - Susan Beckman mentions that \$300 from an emotional support animal deposit adjustment was never refunded.
- **Excessive Cleaning Charges (\$975)**:
    - Cleaning charges appear inflated without supporting documentation or invoices.


#### Citation Location:

- Under **Point (4)** in the "Summary of Argument," cite these examples as evidence of improper accounting practices by the landlord.


#### Enhancement Recommendation:

- Reference **Texas Property Code §92.109**, which requires landlords to provide an itemized list of deductions within 30 days or forfeit their right to retain any portion of the deposit.
- Argue that inflated or undocumented deductions further demonstrate bad faith retention of funds.

---

### **5. Inconsistent Conduct and Documentation**

#### Relevant Statements:

- **Five Lease Versions**:
    - The existence of multiple conflicting leases demonstrates poor document management by the landlord.
- **Missing Brokerage Disclosure**:
    - Miss Connor never received or signed a required brokerage disclosure, violating Texas Real Estate Commission rules.


#### Citation Location:

- Under **Point (5)** in the "Summary of Argument," cite these inconsistencies as evidence undermining the credibility of landlord claims.


#### Enhancement Recommendation:

- Include a reference to TREC Rule §535.148, which mandates proper disclosure practices by leasing agents.
- Argue that poor document management casts doubt on all claims made by the landlord.

---

### Additional Enhancements

1. **Strengthen Legal Citations**:
Add specific references to Texas statutes and case law supporting each argument. For example:
    - *Padilla v. Metro Transit Auth.* for contract formation principles.
    - *Avenell v. Chrisman Properties* for mitigation obligations under §91.006.
2. **Highlight Landlord’s Procedural Failures**:
Emphasize systemic issues such as missing disclosures, mishandled deposits, and conflicting documentation as evidence of bad faith.
3. **Incorporate Visual Evidence**:
If available, include photos or inspection reports showing pre-existing damages (e.g., carpets/stove) alongside tenant statements.
4. **Focus on Mitigation Timeline**:
Highlight how quickly the property was re-listed (June 1) and sold (June 9), demonstrating minimal financial loss attributable to tenants.
5. **Request Specific Remedies in Mediation**:
Clearly outline desired outcomes, such as:
    - Full refund of security deposit due to procedural violations.
    - Waiver of additional payment demands based on invalid lease claims and pre-existing damages.

---

### Conclusion

The provided statements should be strategically cited throughout each point in the mediation brief's "Summary of Argument" section to strengthen key defenses against landlord claims. By incorporating legal references, emphasizing procedural failures, and presenting corroborating evidence from tenant statements, you can build a compelling case for minimizing liability while securing favorable mediation outcomes. Let me know if you need further refinements!
